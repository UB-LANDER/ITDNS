Since the whole map in OpenDS is base on a common coordinate, so have to give every road, every waypoint and every building
a own coordinate according to the google map.
So first, we choose the area we want to model in google map, then measure the length of each road, and the width as well.
The lane width is about 5 in OpenDS in our model. As the road is a flat surface, so the middle of this surface represent the
whole plane, we will set the middle in OpenDs. For example the road's size is 10*10, so if we choose 5'5 as the coordinate, the
the road next to it will be 15'5, these two roads will converge at 10'5, and the border will be 0'5 and 20'5. 
If we are using the same single road model but rotate 90 degree. Then we can simpy change the configuration in the .secne file.

<node name="Plane" >
      <position x="0.000000" y="-30.000000" z="7.460708" />
      <rotation qz="0.000000" qy="0.000000" qx="0.000000" qw="1.000000" />
      <scale y="25.000000" x="5.000000" z="1.000000" />
      
If we want to enlarge the road model, simply change the scale, this is a y-direction road, so in scale we have y= 25 which is
the length, x= 5 which is the width, z =1 is the original height.
If we want to change this y-direction road to x-direction road, simply change qz=1 and keep other unchanged then it's done.
All the road related file is stored under ../asset/Scene/ , including the mesh file for original road imformation, material
and jpg file for the road surface, and .scene file for how you place all the road in a single map.
