#GET and SET Function:
  In my opinion these function in OpenDS and Paramics are complimentary to the pub/sub structure of the openDDS.
  In openDDS, we have topic which defines the object being used to define the behaviour of the messages being shared in the
  pub/sub structure.We need to concentrate a bit on the design of the system to define the topics.
  As of now we can think of either one or two topics - one which initiates the trigger of simulation and the other which 
  carries it on.In openDS, the driving vehicle sends message to the middleware with its location which has been translated
  as per Paramics axes. As of now we have connectionaHandler methods in openDS which does this work of sending message. Upon 
  integration this method will need to be modified to publish its values to the openDDS.
  In Paramics also we have similar methods which are predefined and act as the setters of the location of the driving vehicle in 
  Paramics. They are the  subscribers of the openDS messages and after obtaining the messages will set the location of the vehicle.
